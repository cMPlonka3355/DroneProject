# Drone Networking Project
### FGCU Computer Security Spring 2025

# Description

In the world of drones, security is key to ensure the protection of the drones themselves and of any data they may record and share through the network that connects them to central command. For this reason, we have worked on trying to find method to protect drone networks from attacks that could lead to damaging the drones through self-destructive commands, comandeering the drones, or stealing the data that the drones may collect.
Presented in this project are five areas of protection that, when working in tandem with each other, may provide secure networking and communications between central command and the drones used. Such methods deal with basic protections such as firewall setting to allow only certain connections; address rotation to ensure that the drone cannot be attacked through its address; secure tunneling to encrypt traffic to and from the drones, ensuring secure data; authentication flood prevention to block attempts to perform a DOS against the network while also verifying connections; and WPA3 authentication which allows for validation of drones before connections without requiring a stable IP address.
While the methods as they stand currently do not all work together, they can be combined into different combinations of security to fit the wants and needs of clients seeking better protection for their drones and the data they fetch from them.
